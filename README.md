# Snort 3 Precompiled binaries

This repository contains precompiled binaries (in .deb and .rpm format) of [Snort 3](https://github.com/snort3/snort3) (which is currently in beta) for various Linux distributions. Both x86_64 and armhf architectures are supported; armhf packages for Raspberry Pi are available. All binaries are build and tested using Docker containers, and are updated with newest version of Snort from source on monthly basis. 

## Supported distributions
Currently, packages for following operating systems are available:

- Debian [Buster](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-debian-buster.deb) and [Stretch](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-debian-stretch.deb)
- Fedora [31](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1.fc31.x86_64.rpm) and [30](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1.fc30.x86_64.rpm)
- OpenSUSE Leap [15.1](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1.x86_64-leap-15.1.rpm) and [15.0](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1.x86_64-leap-15.0.rpm)
- Raspbian [Buster](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-raspbian-buster.deb) and [Stretch](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-raspbian-stretch.deb)
- Ubuntu [19.10 Eoan Ermine](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-ubuntu-19.10.deb) and [18.04 Bionic Beaver LTS](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/releases/download/latest/snort3-0.1-1-ubuntu-18.04.deb)

Packages for Debian, Fedora, Raspbian and Ubuntu should work out of the box. For CentOS and OpenSUSE small preconfiguration is necessary. 

### CentOS
You have to add PowerTools repository in dnf:
> dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
> dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm && \
> dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools

After then, provided package should install smoothly:
> dnf install -y ./snort3-0.1-1.el8.x86_64.rpm

### OpenSUE
Zypper accepts only signed packages by default. Packages available here aren't signed, so you have to utilize *--allow-unsigned-rpm* flag:
> zypper --non-interactive install --allow-unsigned-rpm ./snort3-0.1-1.x86_64-leap15.1.rpm

## Docker containers
Each package is build and tested with predefined Docker container. Two types of containers are used:
- build containers: they download all necessary dependencies and current source code of Snort; then, they compile Snort 3 from source and generate .rpm or .deb binary package, which is then copied into [dist](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/tree/master/dist) directory;
- install containers: they copy appropriate package generated by build container and install it, in order to check if installation on fresh system runs correctly. 

All images are uploaded into [Packages](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/packages) section, where you can download them for direct use. As default, containers just finish themselves after copying generated package into [dist](https://github.com/ArturB/snort3-precompiled/tree/master/dist) directory or after installing it; if you want, you may add *--keep* option to *entrypoint.sh* script in each Dockerfile, which keeps container running. You may then log into running container just as into virtual machine and review configuration manually:
> docker exec -it *CONTAINER_ID* /bin/bash

If you have only one docker container running on your system, you may replace *CONTAINER_ID* with:
> docker exec -it $(docker ps -q) /bin/bash
